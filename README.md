The Aavegotchi Project is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi)-enabled Crypto Collectibles game developed by Singapore-based Pixelcraft Studios that allows players to stake Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) avatars with interest-generating aTokens and interact with the Aavegotchi metaverse. It is a unique combination of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and NFTs.

Aavegotchis are pixelated ghosts living on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by the ERC-721 standard. Their value is determined by rarity level, which is calculated via multiple factors, such as base traits, amount of staked collateral/aTokens, and equipped wearables.
